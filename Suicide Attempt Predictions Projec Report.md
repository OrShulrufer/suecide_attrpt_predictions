## <span style="color: green;"><a name="dynamic-automatic-data-scaling"></a>3.2.3 Dynamic and Automatic Data Scaling</span>
---

### <span style="color: blue;">Introduction</span>
---

Feature scaling is an essential step in the preprocessing pipeline, particularly for datasets with features that span multiple scales. In our case, we have various types of features, including counts of doctor appointments and binary indicators. These features are not on the same scale, making scaling crucial. We introduce a dynamic and automatic scaling function that adapts to the characteristics of the data

#### <span style="color: purple;">Automatic Selection of Scaling Method</span>
---

Our function `scale_columns` in `data_preeprocess_functions.py` dynamically selects the best initial scaling method. It considers the feature's skewness and range to decide between log scaling, Min-Max scaling, and Quantile scaling.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Multiple Steps of Scaling</span>
---

The function performs a final Min-Max scaling to ensure all values fall within the 0 to 1 range. This two-step process allows for more robust feature normalization.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Handling True Zeros</span>
---

Our dataset contains "true zeros," and the function respects this by leaving zeros untouched during the scaling process. This maintains the integrity and interpretability of our predictive models.

### <span style="color: blue;">Code Snippets</span>
---

```python
# <span style="color: red;">Code from data_preeprocess_functions.py</span>
---
def scale_columns(df, initial_method='auto', fillna_null=0, debug=False):
    scaler_minmax = MinMaxScaler()
    scaler_quantile = QuantileTransformer()
    
    scaled_df = df.fillna(fillna_null)
    
    for col in scaled_df.columns:
        if debug:
            print(f"Scaling column: {col}")
        
        scaled_df[col].fillna(fillna_null, inplace=True)
        
        if initial_method == 'auto':
            if scaled_df[col].skew() > 1:
                scaled_df[col] = np.log1p(scaled_df[col])
                
            if scaled_df[col].max() - scaled_df[col].min() > 10:
                scaled_df[col] = scaler_quantile.fit_transform(scaled_df[[col]])
            else:
                scaled_df[col] = scaler_minmax.fit_transform(scaled_df[[col]])
        elif initial_method == 'log':
            scaled_df[col] = np.log1p(scaled_df[col])
        elif initial_method == 'minmax':
            scaled_df[col] = scaler_minmax.fit_transform(scaled_df[[col]])
        elif initial_method == 'quantile':
            scaled_df[col] = scaler_quantile.fit_transform(scaled_df[[col]])
            
        scaled_df[col] = scaler_minmax.fit_transform(scaled_df[[col]])

    return scaled_df


#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

This approach to data scaling is both dynamic and automatic, adapting to the specific characteristics of each feature while respecting the true zeros in our dataset. This ensures that our predictive models will be both accurate and interpretable.

### <span style="color: blue;"><a name="create-shifted-period-datasets"></a>3.3.1 Function: create_shifted_period_datasets</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Objective</span>
---

The function `create_shifted_period_datasets()` is tailored to assemble datasets that facilitate time-based predictive modeling of suicide attempts. The goal is to generate a series of datasets where each is designed to predict suicide attempts for a specific next time period after hospitalization, utilizing all available data up to (but not including) that period.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Parameters</span>
---

- `df`: The complete dataframe with all features and target variables.
- `df_before_sorted`: Dataframe containing 'before hospitalization' features.
- `df_after_sorted`: Dataframe containing 'after hospitalization' features.
- `df_not_periods`: Dataframe containing features without any time-specific designation.
- `target_keyword`: String used to identify target columns.
- `debug`: Boolean flag for debugging purposes.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Algorithm Explained</span>
---

1. **Initialize Dictionary**: An empty dictionary `period_datasets` is created to store feature and target datasets for each time period.
   
2. **Time Period Extraction**: The function identifies the unique periods available in the dataset. 

3. **Special Case for 0-to-1 Month Period**: 
    - Features used are a combination of `df_before_sorted` and `df_not_periods`.
    - Targets are derived from the 'after' data corresponding to the first month.
    - NaN values are filled with zero.
  
4. **Iterative Data Segregation**: For each time period, the function:
    - Aggregates all features up to the current period from `df_after_sorted`, and combines them with `df_before_sorted` and `df_not_periods`.
    - Isolates the target variables for the next period.
    - Fills NaN values with zero.
  
5. **Data Storage**: Each feature and target pair is stored in `period_datasets` indexed by the time range they are intended to predict.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

The function `create_shifted_period_datasets()` serves as a foundational building block for model development in this project. It prepares the stage for creating predictive models by organizing the data into time-structured datasets, thereby enabling us to make specific, period-wise suicide attempt predictions starting from the zero point (hospitalization).

### <span style="color: blue;"><a name="model-building-strategy"></a>3.3.2 Model Building Strategy</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Objective</span>
---

The objective under this subsection is to outline the overall strategy employed in the building of predictive models for each period. These models aim to predict suicide attempts for each next time period after hospitalization, starting from the zero point.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Single Pipeline Architecture</span>
---

Contrary to having separate pipelines for 'before' and 'after' hospitalization, the project adopts a single pipeline architecture for every next period's predictions. This approach is optimized to use all available information up until the period in question but does not include information from the target period itself.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Model Choice and Evaluation Metrics</span>
---

Given the zero-inflated nature of the dataset and the criticality of the problem being addressed, specialized classifiers are chosen. Evaluation metrics are selected to give a balanced view of the model's performance, taking into consideration both the class imbalance and the zero-inflated nature of the target variable.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Strategy Steps</span>
---

1. **Data Preparation**: Utilize the datasets generated by `create_shifted_period_datasets()`.
   
2. **Feature Selection**: Apply feature selection techniques to eliminate irrelevant features.
  
3. **Model Training**: Train the selected classifier using the prepared and filtered datasets.
  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employ grid search or similar techniques to fine-tune model parameters.
  
5. **Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC to assess the model's performance.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

This model-building strategy serves as a systematic roadmap for creating effective predictive models for each period, from the point of hospitalization onward. By consolidating all available information and applying specialized techniques, we aim to build models that are both accurate and interpretable, while addressing the unique challenges posed by the dataset's zero-inflated nature.

### <span style="color: blue;"><a name="incorporation-of-evaluation-techniques"></a>3.3.3 Incorporation of Evaluation Techniques</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Objective</span>
---

The purpose of this subsection is to elaborate on the evaluation techniques employed in assessing the predictive models. These techniques are not limited to traditional evaluation metrics but extend to include statistical tests and variance checks.

#### <span style="color: purple;">P-Value</span>
---

The P-value is employed to test the null hypothesis that the model parameters have no effect. A low P-value (< 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, a predictor that has a low P-value is likely to be a meaningful addition to your model.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Wald Test</span>
---

The Wald test is used to understand the impact of each predictor in explaining the variation in the dependent variable. A high Wald statistic value compared to a chi-square distribution leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis, thereby marking the predictor as significant.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Variance Logic</span>
---

Variance in the predicted probabilities is also assessed. A model with low variance in predicted probabilities may be too rigid and not adaptive to the complexities in the dataset. Thus, variance checks act as a measure of model flexibility.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Combined Evaluation</span>
---

The models are evaluated based on a combination of:

1. Traditional metrics like F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
2. P-value to assess statistical significance.
3. Wald Test for parameter significance.
4. Variance in predicted probabilities for model flexibility.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

By incorporating a variety of evaluation techniques, including statistical tests like the P-value and Wald Test, along with variance logic, this project aims to provide a holistic view of model performance. This multi-faceted evaluation ensures that the models are not only accurate but also statistically significant and flexible to the dataset's complexities.


### <span style="color: blue;"><a name="model-optimization-strategies"></a>3.3.4 Model Optimization Strategies</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Objective</span>
---

The objective of this subsection is to outline the strategies employed for optimizing the predictive models after their initial evaluation. This includes parameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble methods.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Hyperparameter Tuning</span>
---

Hyperparameter tuning aims to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model. Techniques such as grid search and random search are used for this purpose.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Feature Importance</span>
---

Based on the initial model evaluations, the features contributing the least to the predictive power of the model are identified. These features may be dropped or transformed for subsequent iterations.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Ensemble Methods</span>
---

Models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are inherently ensemble methods. However, additional ensemble techniques like stacking may be employed to improve the performance of simpler models.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Dynamic Optimization</span>
---

Given that this project deals with time-series data, dynamic optimization techniques may be used to adapt the model to changes in the underlying data distribution over time.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

Optimizing the model is as crucial as building it. The optimization strategies are designed to improve the model's performance without overfitting, thereby ensuring that the model is both robust and adaptable.

### <span style="color: blue;"><a name="limitations-and-challenges"></a>3.3.5 Limitations and Challenges</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Data Imbalance</span>
---

The dataset may have imbalanced classes, which can bias the predictive model. Strategies such as oversampling the minority class or using different evaluation metrics were considered to address this issue.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Feature Engineering</span>
---

While feature engineering can add predictive power to the model, it comes with the risk of overfitting, especially when using complex polynomial features or domain-specific features that may not be generalizable.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Scalability</span>
---

As the model incorporates more features and becomes more complex, computational costs rise, affecting the model's scalability. This is particularly challenging for real-time or near-real-time prediction scenarios.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Hyperparameter Complexity</span>
---

The presence of multiple hyperparameters increases the dimensionality of the optimization problem, making it computationally expensive and potentially leading to local minima.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Ethical Concerns</span>
---

Given that the model aims to predict sensitive outcomes like suicide attempts, ethical considerations around data privacy and the responsible use of predictions are paramount.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

Understanding the limitations and challenges of the model is crucial for both its development and deployment. These issues also provide avenues for future research and improvement.

### <span style="color: blue;"><a name="final-model-selection"></a>3.3.6 Final Model Selection</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Criteria for Selection</span>
---

The final model was selected based on a comprehensive set of criteria which include accuracy, F1-score, computational efficiency, and interpretability.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Selected Model</span>
---

The XGBoost Classifier was the final model selected due to its superior performance metrics and the ability to handle imbalanced classes effectively.

#### <span style="color: purple;">Performance Metrics</span>
---

#### <span style="color: purple;">Conclusion</span>
---

The model deployment stage is a critical juncture where the developed model transitions from a research and development setting into real-world applications. Given the life-critical nature of the model, which aims to predict the suicide attempt risk among recently discharged patients, the deployment process is meticulously planned and executed. The model is embedded within an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that is scheduled for daily runs, thus ensuring that it is continuously updated with fresh data. The ETL process itself is a blend of SQL for data extraction, Python for transformation and analytics, and SAS for detailed reporting.

#### <span style="color: purple;"><a name="preparing-the-model-for-deployment"></a>3.3.7.1 Preparing the Model for Deployment</span>
---

Preparation for deployment involves several steps, each aimed at ensuring that the model performs optimally when integrated into the ETL workflow. 

- **Model Serialization**: The model is serialized into a machine-independent format using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`. This ensures that it can be easily loaded and run within the ETL environment.
  
- **Validation and Testing**: Rigorous validation tests are performed to ensure the model's compatibility with the existing ETL architecture and the SQL Server DB schema. This avoids any potential bottlenecks or conflicts during integration.
  
- **Data Alignment**: Special attention is given to data types, structures, and other schema-specific details to ensure seamless data flow from the SQL Server DB into the model.
  
- **Documentation**: Adequate inline comments and external documentation are prepared to help other team members understand the model's structure, data dependencies, and output format.

These steps make certain that the model is not just theoretically sound but also practically deployable, reliable, and efficient.

#### <span style="color: purple;"><a name="monitoring-and-maintenance"></a>3.3.7.4 Monitoring and Maintenance</span>
---

Monitoring and maintenance are essential for any production-grade model, especially one that predicts sensitive health-related outcomes. Here's how we will ensure that our model remains efficient and accurate:

1. **Performance Metrics Monitoring**: Control-M will be configured to continuously monitor key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

2. **Error Tracking**: Any errors or exceptions during the ETL process will be logged for immediate attention and action.

3. **Automated Alerts**: Critical alerts, especially those related to the prediction of high-risk patients, will be immediately sent via email to healthcare providers.

4. **Data Quality Checks**: Automatic validation checks will be in place to ensure that the data fed into the model meets predefined quality standards.

5. **Resource Utilization**: Memory and CPU utilization will be monitored to ensure optimal resource allocation.

6. **Manual Overrides**: In exceptional circumstances, healthcare providers will have the ability to manually override model predictions based on clinical judgment.

7. **Version Control**: All changes to the model and ETL process will be version-controlled to keep track of modifications and enable rollbacks if needed.

8. **Regular Updates**: The model will be updated periodically based on feedback loops with healthcare providers and the latest academic research.

9. **Audit Trails**: Detailed logs and histories will be maintained for all model operations for auditing purposes.

10. **Compliance Checks**: Regular internal and external audits will be conducted to ensure that the model and its processes comply with healthcare regulations.

11. **Backup and Recovery**: Robust backup and recovery processes will be in place to handle any system failures or data losses.

12. **User Training**: Healthcare providers and system administrators will undergo periodic training to understand the model's functionalities and best practices.

By integrating these monitoring and maintenance practices into our deployment strategy, we ensure the long-term reliability and accuracy of the predictive model.


#### <span style="color: purple;"><a name="rollback-plan"></a>3.3.7.5 Rollback Plan</span>

## <span style="color: green;"><a name="setting-the-significance-level"></a>3.4.3 Setting the Significance Level (\( \alpha \))</span>
---

### <span style="color: blue;">Introduction</span>
---

The significance level (\( \alpha \)) is a crucial parameter in hypothesis testing, including the Wald test. It serves as a threshold for determining statistical significance and thus plays an important role in feature selection and model evaluation.

### <span style="color: blue;">Pros and Cons of Different \( \alpha \) Levels</span>
---

| \( \alpha \) Level | Pros                                               | Cons                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0.01               | Reduces Type I errors (false positives)            | Increases Type II errors (false negatives)          |
| 0.05               | Balanced approach to Type I and Type II errors     | May still include some irrelevant features          |
| 0.10               | Reduces Type II errors                             | Increases Type I errors                             |

### <span style="color: blue;">Explanation</span>
---

- **\( \alpha = 0.01 \)**: Very strict. You're making it hard to reject the null hypothesis, so you're less likely to make a Type I error but more likely to make a Type II error.
  
- **\( \alpha = 0.05 \)**: Standard practice in many fields. It's a balanced approach but still has the risk of including irrelevant features (Type I error) or missing out on important ones (Type II error).
  
- **\( \alpha = 0.10 \)**: More lenient. You're making it easier to reject the null hypothesis, increasing the risk of Type I errors but decreasing the risk of Type II errors.

### <span style="color: blue;">For Your Goals</span>
---

Given the focus on building the best predictive model, \( \alpha = 0.05 \) is often a reasonable default. However, it may be beneficial to experiment with different \( \alpha \) levels and evaluate their impact on the model's predictive performance.
