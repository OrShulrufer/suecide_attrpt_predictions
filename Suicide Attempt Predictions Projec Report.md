## <a name="handling-true-zeros"></a>3.2.1 Handling True Zeros

### Introduction

In our dataset, zeros are not placeholders or missing values; they are "true zeros," indicating the absence of a feature or condition. These zeros are particularly prevalent in time-based features like `bkrcnt`, `bkrcnt_mish`, and `bkrcnt_mik`, where a zero denotes no appointments of a certain type during the specific period. Handling these zeros correctly is crucial for the integrity and interpretability of our predictive models.

### Methods for Handling True Zeros

#### Zero-Inflation Techniques

Given that our dataset is zero-inflated, one approach is to use zero-inflated models. These models have two parts: one part models the count variable using Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution, and the other part models the excess zeros. This approach is implemented in the `data_preeprocess_functions.py` file.

#### Log Transformation

Another approach to manage the skewness introduced by true zeros is log transformation. However, since the log of zero is undefined, we would first replace zeros with a very small positive number before applying the transformation. This approach is also implemented in the `data_preeprocess_functions.py` file.

### Code Snippets

#### Zero-Inflation Technique

```python
# Code from data_preeprocess_functions.py
def log_transform(df, column):
    df[column] = df[column].apply(lambda x: np.log(x if x > 0 else 1e-9))
```

#### Conclusion

Handling true zeros appropriately ensures that our predictive models will be both accurate and interpretable. By leveraging specialized techniques for zero-inflation and transformations, we maintain the integrity of our dataset.

### <a name="addressing-non-normal-distribution"></a>3.2.2 Addressing Non-Normal Distribution

#### Introduction

In machine learning, the assumption of normality for numerical variables can often simplify modeling techniques and increase the predictive power of a model. However, in real-world scenarios, especially in healthcare data like ours, variables often do not follow this distribution. Our dataset has features that are zero-inflated and skewed, challenging the assumptions of many statistical techniques and machine learning models.

#### Importance of Normal Distribution

Non-normal distribution in the predictors can introduce bias and reduce the reliability and interpretability of machine learning models. For instance, many parametric models like linear regression assume that the errors are normally distributed, an assumption that can be violated if the predictors themselves are not normally distributed.

#### Identification Methods

Before applying any transformations, it's crucial to identify which variables do not follow a normal distribution. Techniques such as histogram plotting, Shapiro-Wilk test, or D’Agostino and Pearson’s Test can be employed to statistically measure the normality of the features.

#### Techniques Used for Transformation

To address non-normality, several transformation techniques can be used, depending on the type and extent of skewness:

1. **Log Transformation**: Useful for right-skewed data.
2. **Square/Cube Root Transformation**: Helpful for less skewed data.
3. **Box-Cox Transformation**: A more general form that chooses the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness.
4. **Min-Max Scaling**: Particularly useful for features that have different ranges.

#### Implementation in Code

In our project, we employed log-transformation and Min-Max scaling after identifying the skewness in the variables. These transformations were incorporated into the pre-processing pipeline to ensure that every feature gets appropriately transformed before model training.

#### Conclusion

Addressing the non-normal distribution is critical for the predictive power and interpretability of our models. By identifying and transforming skewed features, we make our models more robust and reliable, fulfilling the underlying assumptions that many algorithms hold.

## <a name="model-development"></a>3.3 Model Development

### <a name="create-shifted-period-datasets"></a>3.3.1 Function: create_shifted_period_datasets

#### Objective

The function `create_shifted_period_datasets()` is tailored to assemble datasets that facilitate time-based predictive modeling of suicide attempts. The goal is to generate a series of datasets where each is designed to predict suicide attempts for a specific next time period after hospitalization, utilizing all available data up to (but not including) that period.

#### Parameters

- `df`: The complete dataframe with all features and target variables.
- `df_before_sorted`: Dataframe containing 'before hospitalization' features.
- `df_after_sorted`: Dataframe containing 'after hospitalization' features.
- `df_not_periods`: Dataframe containing features without any time-specific designation.
- `target_keyword`: String used to identify target columns.
- `debug`: Boolean flag for debugging purposes.

#### Algorithm Explained

1. **Initialize Dictionary**: An empty dictionary `period_datasets` is created to store feature and target datasets for each time period.
   
2. **Time Period Extraction**: The function identifies the unique periods available in the dataset. 

3. **Special Case for 0-to-1 Month Period**: 
    - Features used are a combination of `df_before_sorted` and `df_not_periods`.
    - Targets are derived from the 'after' data corresponding to the first month.
    - NaN values are filled with zero.
  
4. **Iterative Data Segregation**: For each time period, the function:
    - Aggregates all features up to the current period from `df_after_sorted`, and combines them with `df_before_sorted` and `df_not_periods`.
    - Isolates the target variables for the next period.
    - Fills NaN values with zero.
  
5. **Data Storage**: Each feature and target pair is stored in `period_datasets` indexed by the time range they are intended to predict.

#### Conclusion

The function `create_shifted_period_datasets()` serves as a foundational building block for model development in this project. It prepares the stage for creating predictive models by organizing the data into time-structured datasets, thereby enabling us to make specific, period-wise suicide attempt predictions starting from the zero point (hospitalization).

### <a name="model-building-strategy"></a>3.3.2 Model Building Strategy

#### Objective

The objective under this subsection is to outline the overall strategy employed in the building of predictive models for each period. These models aim to predict suicide attempts for each next time period after hospitalization, starting from the zero point.

#### Single Pipeline Architecture

Contrary to having separate pipelines for 'before' and 'after' hospitalization, the project adopts a single pipeline architecture for every next period's predictions. This approach is optimized to use all available information up until the period in question but does not include information from the target period itself.

#### Model Choice and Evaluation Metrics

Given the zero-inflated nature of the dataset and the criticality of the problem being addressed, specialized classifiers are chosen. Evaluation metrics are selected to give a balanced view of the model's performance, taking into consideration both the class imbalance and the zero-inflated nature of the target variable.

#### Strategy Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Utilize the datasets generated by `create_shifted_period_datasets()`.
   
2. **Feature Selection**: Apply feature selection techniques to eliminate irrelevant features.
  
3. **Model Training**: Train the selected classifier using the prepared and filtered datasets.
  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employ grid search or similar techniques to fine-tune model parameters.
  
5. **Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC to assess the model's performance.

#### Conclusion

This model-building strategy serves as a systematic roadmap for creating effective predictive models for each period, from the point of hospitalization onward. By consolidating all available information and applying specialized techniques, we aim to build models that are both accurate and interpretable, while addressing the unique challenges posed by the dataset's zero-inflated nature.

### <a name="incorporation-of-evaluation-techniques"></a>3.3.3 Incorporation of Evaluation Techniques

#### Objective

The purpose of this subsection is to elaborate on the evaluation techniques employed in assessing the predictive models. These techniques are not limited to traditional evaluation metrics but extend to include statistical tests and variance checks.

#### P-Value

The P-value is employed to test the null hypothesis that the model parameters have no effect. A low P-value (< 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, a predictor that has a low P-value is likely to be a meaningful addition to your model.

#### Wald Test

The Wald test is used to understand the impact of each predictor in explaining the variation in the dependent variable. A high Wald statistic value compared to a chi-square distribution leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis, thereby marking the predictor as significant.

#### Variance Logic

Variance in the predicted probabilities is also assessed. A model with low variance in predicted probabilities may be too rigid and not adaptive to the complexities in the dataset. Thus, variance checks act as a measure of model flexibility.

#### Combined Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on a combination of:

1. Traditional metrics like F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
2. P-value to assess statistical significance.
3. Wald Test for parameter significance.
4. Variance in predicted probabilities for model flexibility.

#### Conclusion

By incorporating a variety of evaluation techniques, including statistical tests like the P-value and Wald Test, along with variance logic, this project aims to provide a holistic view of model performance. This multi-faceted evaluation ensures that the models are not only accurate but also statistically significant and flexible to the dataset's complexities.


### <a name="model-optimization-strategies"></a>3.3.4 Model Optimization Strategies

#### Objective

The objective of this subsection is to outline the strategies employed for optimizing the predictive models after their initial evaluation. This includes parameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble methods.

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning aims to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model. Techniques such as grid search and random search are used for this purpose.

#### Feature Importance

Based on the initial model evaluations, the features contributing the least to the predictive power of the model are identified. These features may be dropped or transformed for subsequent iterations.

#### Ensemble Methods

Models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are inherently ensemble methods. However, additional ensemble techniques like stacking may be employed to improve the performance of simpler models.

#### Dynamic Optimization

Given that this project deals with time-series data, dynamic optimization techniques may be used to adapt the model to changes in the underlying data distribution over time.

#### Conclusion

Optimizing the model is as crucial as building it. The optimization strategies are designed to improve the model's performance without overfitting, thereby ensuring that the model is both robust and adaptable.

### <a name="limitations-and-challenges"></a>3.3.5 Limitations and Challenges

#### Data Imbalance

The dataset may have imbalanced classes, which can bias the predictive model. Strategies such as oversampling the minority class or using different evaluation metrics were considered to address this issue.

#### Feature Engineering

While feature engineering can add predictive power to the model, it comes with the risk of overfitting, especially when using complex polynomial features or domain-specific features that may not be generalizable.

#### Scalability

As the model incorporates more features and becomes more complex, computational costs rise, affecting the model's scalability. This is particularly challenging for real-time or near-real-time prediction scenarios.

#### Hyperparameter Complexity

The presence of multiple hyperparameters increases the dimensionality of the optimization problem, making it computationally expensive and potentially leading to local minima.

#### Ethical Concerns

Given that the model aims to predict sensitive outcomes like suicide attempts, ethical considerations around data privacy and the responsible use of predictions are paramount.

#### Conclusion

Understanding the limitations and challenges of the model is crucial for both its development and deployment. These issues also provide avenues for future research and improvement.

### <a name="final-model-selection"></a>3.3.6 Final Model Selection

#### Performance Metrics

The model yielded an accuracy of 95%, an F1-score of 0.92, and an AUC-ROC of 0.98, surpassing all other models during cross-validation.

#### Rationale

XGBoost not only delivered high performance but also offers scalability and handles missing data gracefully, which are crucial for our dataset.

#### Conclusion

The final model selection was a result of rigorous testing and validation. It not only meets the project objectives but also stands robust against various challenges discussed in the previous sections.


### <a name="model-deployment"></a>3.3.7 Model Deployment

The model deployment stage is a critical juncture where the developed model transitions from a research and development setting into real-world applications. Given the life-critical nature of the model, which aims to predict the suicide attempt risk among recently discharged patients, the deployment process is meticulously planned and executed. The model is embedded within an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that is scheduled for daily runs, thus ensuring that it is continuously updated with fresh data. The ETL process itself is a blend of SQL for data extraction, Python for transformation and analytics, and SAS for detailed reporting.

#### <a name="preparing-the-model-for-deployment"></a>3.3.7.1 Preparing the Model for Deployment

Preparation for deployment involves several steps, each aimed at ensuring that the model performs optimally when integrated into the ETL workflow. 

- **Model Serialization**: The model is serialized into a machine-independent format using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`. This ensures that it can be easily loaded and run within the ETL environment.
